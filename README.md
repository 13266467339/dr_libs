# About
This repository is a container for single-file, public domain libraries. All libraries are
written in C, but they should be compilable by a C++ compiler.

Not every library is versioned which usually means it's APIs are unstable. Versioned libraries
have stable APIs, but on rare occasions I may need to make some minor changes.

Library                                         | Version | Description
