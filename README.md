# About
This repository is a container for single-file, public domain libraries written in C. Each
file in this library are independant of the others, except where noted. Click the links for
more detailed information.

- [dr_flac](https://mackron.github.io/dr_flac): A simple library for decoding FLAC files.
- [dr_wav](https://mackron.github.io/dr_wav): A simple library for reading audio data from .wav files.
- dr_obj: A simple library for loading Wavefront OBJ files. Currently only supports a tiny subset of
features.
- dr_fs: A library that abstracts file IO to allow one to load files from both the native file system
and archives such as Zip files.
- dr_fsw: A library for watching for changes to the file system. Currently only supports Windows.
- dr_path: A path manipulation library.
- dr_gui: A low-level GUI library.
- dr_util: A library with miscellaneous functionality that doesn't really belong to
any particular category.
- dr_mtl: A compiler for materials for use in graphics software. Takes a material file
(such as Wavefront MTL files), compiles it into an intermediate bytecode representation,
then generates shader code (GLSL, etc.)
- dr_audio (WIP): A simple library for audio playback and recording. Very incomplete and
work-in-progress.
- dr_2d (WIP): A work-in-progress library for drawing 2D graphics.
- dr_math (WIP): A very incomplete vector math library. You don't want to be using this
right now.
