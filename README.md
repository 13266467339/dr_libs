# About
This repository is a container for some of my single-file libraries. All libraries are written
in C, but they should be compilable by a C++ compiler.

Not every library is versioned which usually means it's APIs are unstable. Versioned libraries
have stable APIs, but on rare occasions I may need to make some minor changes.

Library                                         | Description
----------------------------------------------- | -----------
[dr_flac](dr_flac.h)                            | FLAC audio decoder.
[dr_wav](dr_wav.h)                              | WAV audio loader and writer.
[dr_pcx](dr_pcx.h)                              | PCX image loader.
[dr_obj](dr_obj.h)                              | Wavefront OBJ model loader.
[dr_math](dr_math.h)                            | Vector math library. Very incomplete, and only updated as I need it.
