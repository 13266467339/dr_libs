# About
easy_vfs is an implementation of a virtual file system which allows you to load files
from archives/packages (such as zip files) using a common API.

Some noteworthy features:
 - Specify multiple base directories at load time and have the library automatically search
   them when loading relative paths.
 - Supports verbose absolute paths to avoid ambiguity. For example you can specify a path
   such as "my/package.zip/file.txt"
 - Supports shortened paths by automatically scanning for supported archives/packages. The
   path "my/package.zip/file.txt" can be shortened to "my/file.txt", for example.
 - Fully recursive. A path such as "pack1.zip/pack2.zip/file.txt" should work just fine.
 - Easily supports custom package formats - just implement the relevant callbacks. See
   the "extras" folder for examples.
 
The above examples use zip files, however they are not currently supported. This will
be coming very soon.


 
# How to use it
There's just a few files. Just add these to your project's source tree and you should be
good to go. The "extras" folder contains implementations of supported package formats -
just include the ones you want, and leave out the ones you don't. There isn't much here
yet, but support for zip files will be coming very soon.

Below is an example:
```c
// Create a context.
easyvfs_context* pVFS = easyvfs_createcontext();
if (pVFS == NULL)
{
	// There was an error creating the context.
}

// Register the archive callbacks. This enables support for a particular type of
// package. If you do not specify any packages only the native file system will be
// supported.
easyvfs_registerarchivecallbacks_mtl(pVFS);	// Wavefront MTL files.
easyvfs_registerarchivecallbacks_zip(pVFS);	// ZIP files. Not yet implemented, but coming soon.

// Add your base directories for loading from relative paths. If you do not specify at
// least one base directory you will need to load from absolute paths.
easyvfs_addbasedirectory(pVFS, "C:/Users/Admin");
easyvfs_addbasedirectory(pVFS, "C:/My/Folder");

...

// Open a file. A relative path was specified which means it will first check it against
// "C:/Users/Admin", and then "C:/My/Folder" if it couldn't be found the first time.
easyvfs_file* pFile = easyvfs_openfile(pVFS, "my/file.txt", easyvfs_readwrite);
if (pFile == NULL)
{
	// There was an error loading the file. It probably doesn't exist.
}

easyvfs_readfile(pFile, buffer, bufferSize);
easyvfs_closefile(pFile);

...

// Shutdown.
easyvfs_deletecontext(pVFS);
```
